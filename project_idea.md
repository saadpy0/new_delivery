Food Delivery Limiter App – Brief Description
A simple mobile app designed to help people (especially young adults) curb excessive spending on food delivery apps like DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Swiggy, Zomato, etc.
Core features:

Tracks all your delivery orders and spending in one dashboard.
Lets you set weekly or monthly budget caps (e.g., $100/week).
Hard-blocks access to delivery apps once you hit the limit (with optional short cooldown or accountability step to override).
Provides spending reports, habit streaks, and gentle reminders to cook at home instead.
Goal: Reduce impulse orders, cut guilt/regret, and save $100–300+ per month.

features we need to add pertaining to these problems : - **Automated Financial Friction:** People want an app that doesn't just block the delivery app, but makes it *financially painful* or *annoying* to open (e.g., "Pay $5 to the charity you hate to open UberEats").
- **The "Bridge" Resource:** A lack of resources that help transition from "delivery addict" to "simple cook." Most resources assume you want to go from 0 to 100 (full meal prep).
- **Visualized Opportunity Cost:** No tool currently shows, in real-time, what your specific order is "stealing" from your future goals (e.g., "This pizza just cost you 3 days of your summer vacation").
